**Lossless Compression**


Lossless compression is used where it is important that the original data and the compressed data to be identical. One of the big drawbacks to lossless compression is that for every file the algorithm makes smaller, it will make another file larger.


Though it should be noted that there is no perfect lossless compression. Meaning that any lossless compression algorithm that is used will not work for one hundred percent of data files.

As you can tell from the two images above lossless compression keeps the quality of the original image while decreasing the size of the image as well.
