**Types of Compression**


Hi my name is Cade Holtzen and this markdown will be centered around types of compression.

There are two types of image compression. There is lossless and lossy compression. Lossy compression means that as you compress the image you also lose some of the quality and sharp edges of the image. Lossy compression is done by approximating the details of the image as well as discarding bits of the image.
