**Types of Compression**


Hi my name is Cade Holtzen and this markdown will be centered around types of compression.

This tutorial is geared towards people who have no prior understanding of the types of compression and are looking to get the basic knowledge to understand the types of compression.

There are two types of image compression. There is lossless and lossy compression. Lossy compression means that as you compress the image you also lose some of the quality and sharp edges of the image. Lossy compression is done by approximating the details of the image as well as discarding bits of the image.

Lossless compression allows the original data to be perfectly reconstructed from the compressed data with no loss of information. Lossless compression is used in many applications such as: ZIP files, MP3 audio files, and GIFâ€™s.
