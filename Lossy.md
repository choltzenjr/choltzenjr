The images above help show the difference between an uncompressed image and that of a compressed image. The one on the left is the uncompressed version and can be detailed by its sharp edges and high-quality details. The image on the right is an image that has been compressed multiple times and is seeing the loss of quality – it has heavy pixelization and the overall image looks blurry. 


While lossy compression can cause image degradation, well designed lossy compression has little degradation on the image – this can also be called _visually lossless._ 

_Visually lossless_ just means that after the lossy compression the image cannot be visually told apart from an actual lossless companion. Lossy compression can create images with very small file sizes and is best used to compress multimedia data or data that doesn’t need to be super clear.
